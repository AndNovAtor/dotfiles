Some of my configuration files from $HOME


Installation:

First, backup your old config files! To see which files to backup, look into
copy_into_home/ folder of this project.

Then clone this repo into your home dir:
git clone https://github.com/AndNovAtor/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

or if you is already in home dir - simple:
git clone https://github.com/AndNovAtor/dotfiles.git

Copy the files that link to those in dotfiles:
(WARNING: This will OVERWRITE your old .bashrc, .bash_aliases etc!)
cp ~/dotfiles/copy_into_home/.* ~/

or copy the files one by one - if you don't want use, for example, .XCompose.

or copy all files without .XCompose and .irb:
cp ~/dotfiles/copy_into_home/.bash* ~
cp ~/dotfiles/copy_into_home/.inputrc ~


Optional:

Config global gitignore:
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/dotfiles/gitignore_global

If you want your .XCompose to work, check out these instructions on setting
default system input mode to XIM: https://wiki.edubuntu.org/ComposeKey
You may need to `apt-get install im-switch` if it is not installed by default.

Add some custom config to new files in your home dir, and have fun!
