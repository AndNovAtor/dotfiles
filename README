Some of my configuration files from $HOME


Installation:

First, backup your old config files! To see which files to backup, look into
copy_into_home/ folder of this project.

Then clone this repo into your home dir:
git clone git://github.com/NIA/dotfiles.git $HOME/dotfiles

Copy the files that link to those in dotfiles:
(WARNING: This will OVERWRITE your old .bashrc, .bash_aliases etc!)
cp $HOME/dotfiles/copy_into_home/.* $HOME/

Config global gitignore:
git config --global core.excludesfile $HOME/dotfiles/gitignore_global

If you want your .XCompose to work, check out these instructions on setting
default system input mode to XIM: https://wiki.edubuntu.org/ComposeKey

Add some custom config to new files in your home dir, and have fun!
